it's day 1 of learning java springboot, and I successfully learnt:
- to use spring initialiser to deal with versions of springboot and java, then easily import it into IDE
- about basic understanding of the execution of the project, like:
  -- Pid (ProcessID for each ) assigned
  -- Api endpoint development using @RestController
  -- @GetMapping("abc") for path of api endpoint
  -- context path (@RestMapping("xyz")) for api endpoint at a particular path
